# ðŸ§  Run-1 LIQUID NEURAL NETWORK LNNðŸš€

## True Liquid Time-Constant (LTC) Cell

- Implemented proper continuous-time dynamics with learnable time constants
- Added decay factor based on tau parameter that controls information flow

---

## Enhanced Architecture

- Multi-layer capability for deeper networks
- Self-attention mechanism for capturing temporal relationships
- Skip connections and layer normalization for better gradient flow

---

## Robust Training Framework

- Learning rate scheduling with `ReduceLROnPlateau`
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients
- AdamW optimizer with weight decay for regularization

---

## Comprehensive Evaluation

- Detailed metrics for both classification and regression
- Visualization of results (confusion matrices, prediction plots)
- Feature importance analysis for regression tasks

---

## Hyperparameter Tuning

- Simple grid search to find optimal model configuration
- Best model checkpointing

---

## Improved Data Handling

- Better error handling for dataset loading
- Proper input normalization
- Support for both sequence and non-sequence data formats

---

The code is now much more robust, handles edge cases better, and should provide significantly better performance on both classification and regression tasks.
